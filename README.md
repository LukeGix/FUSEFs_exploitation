# FUSEFs_exploitation
An example of a FUSE filesystem that can be used in kernel exploitation as a replacement for userfaultfd technique

## Usage

Compile the file `fusefs.c` using: `gcc -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 fusefs.c `pkg-config fuse --cflags --libs` -o fusefs.o`

`Note:` make sure you have the `libfuse-dev` package installed on your system

To start FUSE filesystem on a directory, execute `./fusefs.o <name_dir>`.

If you want debug output, use `./fusefs.o -d -s -f <name_dir>`

## Structure of the repo

`fusefs.c`: it implements all the logic of the filesystem, here you can find the definition of the FUSE file operations

`fuse_dir`: this is the directory that will be mounted with the FUSE filesystem

`test.c`: A simple program to test FUSE filesystem

Enjoy! :)
